# Inbound-Inventory-List-and-Invoice-Reconciliation-System-supported-by-Volcano-Engine-
Supermarket inbound inventory list statistics and e-invoice reconciliation system. Built on a Flask backend and powered by Volcano Engine AI, the system supports uploading images of inbound inventory lists and e-invoices. It automatically recognizes and extracts product information, converts it into Markdown format, and intelligently compares the data from the two sources to identify discrepancies. The system precisely pinpoints mismatches in product names, packaging units, amounts, quantities, and other key fields, thereby improving the efficiency of financial reconciliation.
